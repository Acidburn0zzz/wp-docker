# What will you find here ?

This a quick demo around Wordpress running on Docker.
We use some differents stack in order to be complete :
* A [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) based-VM is used, aiming the demo to be portable.
* The OS of this VM is [boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/bootdocker) for running Docker with the lightweight overhead possible.
* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) is used to manage this VM (start/stop/etc.), the goal is to use the command line, be portable, and a bit practical.
* Some pieces of this big cake are inspired from @ubermuda's speech at the Paris SFLive 2014 - https://github.com/ubermuda/sflive-docker
